# SQIR

## Overview

SQIR is a **S**mall **Q**uantum **I**ntermediate **R**epresentation for quantum programs. Its main application is as an IR in a **V**erified **O**ptimizer for **Q**uantum **C**ircuits (VOQC).

We describe SQIR and VOQC in [this draft](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~mwh/papers/hietala19voqc.html). A preliminary version of this work was presented at QPL 2019 and an updated version was presented at PLanQC 2020.

Our repository is split into two parts: SQIR and VOQC. If you are interested in verification of quantum programs, you should focus on the SQIR directory (we also recommend Robert Rand's [Verified Quantum Computing tutorial](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~rrand/vqc/index.html)). If you are interested in our verified compiler then take a look at the VOQC directory.

## Compilation

**If you want to compile the VOQC optimizer, follow the directions below.** 

Dependencies:
  * OCaml version 4.08.1 
  * zarith (`opam install zarith`)
  * dune (`opam install dune`)
  * menhir (`opam install menhir`)
  * OCaml OpenQASM parser (`opam install openQASM`)

`make voqc` will produce an executable in VOQC/_build/default. See [the README in the VOQC directory](VOQC/README.md) for instructions on how to run the optimizer.

**If you want to compile our Coq proofs, follow the directions below.**

Dependencies:
  * OCaml version 4.08.1
  * Coq version 8.10.1

Run `make` to compile the core files of SQIR, `make optimizer` to compile proofs about the circuit optimizer, and `make examples` to compile proofs of correctness for small quantum programs. Use `make all` to compile everything. The development has been tested with Coq version 8.10.1 and OCaml version 4.08.1 on a MacBook Pro. Our proofs are resource intensive, so expect `make all` to take around an hour and a half. We have experienced memory errors on some Linux machines, we are working to resolve this.

## SQIR Directory Contents

### src

Definition of the SQIR language.

- src/SQIR.v : General definition of the SQIR language.
- src/UnitarySem.v : Semantics for unitary SQIR programs.
- src/DensitySem.v : Density matrix semantics for general SQIR programs.
- src/NDSem.v : Non-deterministic semantics for general SQIR programs.
